## Quickly Pick the colors corresponding to the appropriate button, You win by either eliminating the Boss (you) which has 1000HP. 
## Make sure you finish before the timer runs out, and try not to make more than 3 mistakes or its Game Over :(

## :page_with_curl: Overview:
This is our week 9 porject for Webahead4.
The idea is quickly clicking the button that corresponds to the correct color shown.

## :construction_worker: :construction:   Our process

We picked out of many ideas for an interactive game that uses React, discussed them until we decided on one : Qucik Pick - Quickly picking a button which corresponds to the appropraite color shown.

1. First thing was planning how our website is going to look like, design wise.
2. After that we decided how the file structure will be like and built that and pushed it to our repo.
3. We made a rotation between our 4 team members, each coding a different file and the rest of the team is there to help and code check.
5. Wrote tests to test our game.
6. The entire time we push any meaningful change we do and merge and try to all work on the same files.
7. The coding never ends but the deadend is sure to arrive, last little bug fixes after code review.

## :hatching_chick: :hatched_chick:  Our struggles
 
Using React turned out to be harder than expected we had some struggle with things such as : 
- Planning how all the components will work before imeplenting anything.
- Creating the timer and Figuring out how to implement setTimeOut.
- Netlify didn't run because of an issue we had in our json file.

---

## :chicken: Learning outcomes
 
- setting up a React game.
- setting up and connecting different components to our App.js
- figuring out how to use props to make our code cleaner.

## :fast_forward:  Current limitations and future goals
### Limitations:
- The app works but buttons shuffle rather quickly making it harder.
- No option of choosing a difficulty.
- No database to save the current connected user score and best time.

### Future goals
- Options to choose diffficulty. (Easy: more time, less health, more hearts...etc).
- making a database for users to save their score and best time.
